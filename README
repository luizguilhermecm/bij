Operational Systems Assignment

That software has the objective of make a hierarchical routing with regions.
Its starts with an initial table what had all the adjacent nodes.
The table is made with a node_generator.c and for run it need pass 2 arguments (id and ip).

Compiling:      $make
                $make gen

make compile the RPC and make gen compile the generator of nodes.

Limitations: That software works with a limitation what is decided in MAX variable in bij.x, client.c, server.c and node_generator.c
MAX is the maximum of lines in table, so, the number of adjacents plus number of regions has to be less than MAX.
